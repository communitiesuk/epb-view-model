Insulation should not be placed below any cold water storage tank, any such tank should also be insulated on its sides and top, and there should be boarding on battens over the insulation to provide safe access between the loft hatch and the cold water tank. The insulation can be installed by professional contractors but also by a capable DIY enthusiast. Loose granules may be used instead of insulation quilt; this form of loft insulation can be blown into place and can be useful where access is difficult. The loft space must have adequate ventilation to prevent dampness; seek advice about this if unsure.

As specialist machinery is used to fill the cavity, a professional installation company should carry out this work, and they should carry out a thorough survey before commencing work to ensure that this type of insulation is suitable for this home and its exposure.

      <Improvement-Description language="1">Solid wall insulation involves adding a layer of insulation to either the inside or the outside surface of the external walls, which reduces heat loss and lowers fuel bills. As it is more expensive than cavity wall insulation it is only recommended for walls without a cavity, or where for technical reasons a cavity cannot be filled. Internal insulation, known as dry-lining, is where a layer of insulation is fixed to the inside surface of external walls; this type of insulation is best applied when rooms require redecorating and can be installed by a competent DIY enthusiast. External solid wall insulation is the application of an insulant and a weather-protective finish to the outside of the wall. This may improve the look of the home, particularly where existing brickwork or rendering is poor, and will provide long-lasting weather protection. Further information can be obtained from the National Insulation Association (www.nationalinsulationassociation.org.uk).

      <Improvement-Description language="1">Increasing the thickness of existing insulation by adding an 80 mm cylinder jacket around the hot water cylinder will help maintain the water at the required temperature; this will reduce the amount of energy used and lower fuel bills. The jacket should be fitted over the top of the existing foam insulation and over any thermostat clamped to the cylinder. Hot water pipes from the hot water cylinder should also be insulated, using pre-formed pipe insulation of up to 50 mm thickness (or to suit the space available) for as far as they can be accessed to reduce losses in summer. All these materials can be purchased from DIY stores and installed by a competent DIY enthusiast.</Improvement-Description>

      <Improvement-Heading language="1">Loft insulation</Improvement-Heading>
      <Improvement-Description language="1">Loft insulation laid in the loft space or between roof rafters to a depth of at least 270 mm will significantly reduce heat loss through the roof; this will improve levels of comfort, reduce energy use and lower fuel bills. Insulation should not be placed below any cold water storage tank; any such tank should also be insulated on its sides and top, and there should be boarding on battens over the insulation to provide safe access between the loft hatch and the cold water tank. The insulation can be installed by professional contractors but also by a capable DIY enthusiast. Loose granules may be used instead of insulation quilt; this form of loft insulation can be blown into place and can be useful where access is difficult. The loft space must have adequate ventilation to prevent dampness; seek advice about this if unsure (particularly if installing insulation between rafters because a vapour control layer and ventilation above the insulation are required).

      <Improvement-Description language="1">Cavity wall insulation, to fill the gap between the inner and outer layers of external walls with an insulating material, reduces heat loss; this will improve levels of comfort, reduce energy use and lower fuel bills. The insulation material is pumped into the gap through small holes that are drilled into the outer walls, and the holes are made good afterwards. As specialist machinery is used to fill the cavity, a professional installation company should carry out this work, and they should carry out a thorough survey before commencing work to ensure that this type of insulation is suitable for this home. They should also provide a guarantee for the work and handle any building control issues.

      <Improvement-Description language="1">Solid wall insulation involves adding a layer of insulation to either the inside or the outside surface of the external walls, which reduces heat loss and lowers fuel bills. As it is more expensive than cavity wall insulation it is only recommended for walls without a cavity, or where for technical reasons a cavity cannot be filled. Internal insulation, known as dry-lining, is where a layer of insulation is fixed to the inside surface of external walls; this type of insulation is best applied when rooms require redecorating and can be installed by a competent DIY enthusiast. External solid wall insulation is the application of an insulant and a weather-protective finish to the outside of the wall. This may improve the look of the home, particularly where existing brickwork or rendering is poor, and will provide long-lasting weather protection.

This electricity is used throughout the home in the same way as the electricity purchased from an energy supplier. The British Wind Energy Association has up-to-date information on suppliers of small-scale wind systems. Wind turbines are not suitable for all properties. The system’s effectiveness depends on local wind speeds and the presence of nearby obstructions, and a site survey should be undertaken by an accredited installer.</Improvement-Description>

    <Addendum-Number>1</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>1. Wall type does not correspond to options available in RdSAP</Circumstances>
    <Addendum-Text language="1">The dwelling has a type of wall that is not included in the available options. The nearest equivalent type was used for the assessment.</Addendum-Text>
    <Addendum-Text language="2">Mae gan yr annedd fath o wal sydd heb ei gynnwys yn yr opsiynau sydd ar gael. Defnyddiwyd y math cyfatebol agosaf ar gyfer yr asesiad.</Addendum-Text>
  </Addendum>
  <Addendum>
    <Addendum-Number>4</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>4. Dwelling has a swimming pool</Circumstances>
    <Addendum-Text language="1">The energy assessment for the dwelling does not include energy used to heat the swimming pool.</Addendum-Text>
    <Addendum-Text language="2">Dydy asesiad ynni’r annedd ddim yn cynnwys yr ynni a gaiff ei ddefnyddio i wresogi’r pwll nofio.</Addendum-Text>
  </Addendum>
  <Addendum>
    <Addendum-Number>5</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>5. Dwelling has micro-CHP</Circumstances>
    <Addendum-Text language="1">The performance characteristics of the micro-CHP system in this dwelling are not known and default values were used for the assessment.</Addendum-Text>
    <Addendum-Text language="2">Nid yw nodweddion perfformiad y system CHP meicro yn yr annedd hon yn hysbys a chafodd gwerthoedd diofyn eu defnyddio at yr asesiad.</Addendum-Text>
  </Addendum>
  <Addendum>
    <Addendum-Number>6</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>6. Storage heater or dual immersion, and single electric meter</Circumstances>
    <Addendum-Text language="1">A dual rate appliance(s) is present with a single-rate supply. A single-rate appliance has been used for the assessment. Changing the electricity tariff to an off-peak (dual rate) supply is likely to reduce fuel costs and improve the energy rating.</Addendum-Text>
    <Addendum-Text language="2">Mae yma gyfarpar cyfradd ddeuol a chyflenwad cyfradd sengl. At ddibenion yr asesiad, cyfarpar cyfradd sengl sydd wedi’i ddefnyddio. Mae’n debyg y byddai newid y tariff trydan i gyflenwad heblaw’r cyflenwad oriau brig (cyfradd ddeuol) yn lleihau costau tanwydd ac yn gwella’r cyfraddiad ynni.</Addendum-Text>
  </Addendum>
  <Addendum>
    <Addendum-Number>8</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>8. PVs or wind turbine present on the property (England, Wales or Scotland)</Circumstances>

  </Addendum>
  <Addendum>
    <Addendum-Number>9</Addendum-Number>
    <Circumstances>9. Two main heating systems and heating system upgrade is recommended</Circumstances>
    <Addendum-Text language="1">As there is more than one heating system, you should seek professional advice on the most cost-effective option for upgrading the systems.</Addendum-Text>
    <Addendum-Text language="2">Gan fod mwy nag un system wresogi, dylech ofyn am gyngor proffesiynol am y dewis mwyaf cost-effeithiol i uwchraddio’r systemau.</Addendum-Text>
