					<xs:documentation>Loft insulation laid in the loft space or between roof rafters to a depth of at least 270 mm will significantly reduce heat loss through the roof; this will improve levels of comfort, reduce energy use and lower fuel bills. Insulation should not be placed below any cold water storage tank, any such tank should also be insulated on its sides and top, and there should be boarding on battens over the insulation to provide safe access between the loft hatch and the cold water tank. The insulation can be installed by professional contractors but also by a capable DIY enthusiast. Loose granules may be used instead of insulation quilt; this form of loft insulation can be blown into place and can be useful where access is difficult. The loft space must have adequate ventilation to prevent dampness; seek advice about this if unsure. Further information about loft insulation and details of local contractors can be obtained from the National Insulation Association (www.nationalinsulationassociation.org.uk).</xs:documentation>

The insulation material is pumped into the gap through small holes that are drilled into the outer walls, and the holes are made good afterwards. As specialist machinery is used to fill the cavity, a professional installation company should carry out this work, and they should carry out a thorough survey before commencing work to ensure that this type of insulation is suitable for this home. They should also provide a guarantee for the work and handle any building control issues.

					<xs:documentation>Solid wall insulation involves adding a layer of insulation to either the inside or the outside surface of the external walls, which reduces heat loss and lowers fuel bills. As it is more expensive than cavity wall insulation it is only recommended for walls without a cavity, or where for technical reasons a cavity cannot be filled. Internal insulation, known as dry-lining, is where a layer of insulation is fixed to the inside surface of external walls; this type of insulation is best applied when rooms require redecorating and can be installed by a competent DIY enthusiast. External solid wall insulation is the application of an insulant and a weather-protective finish to the outside of the wall. This may improve the look of the home, particularly where existing brickwork or rendering is poor, and will provide long-lasting weather protection. Further information can be obtained from the National Insulation Association (www.nationalinsulationassociation.org.uk).

For example, they can be set to be warmer in the living room and bathroom than in the bedrooms.

					<xs:documentation>The heating system controls should be improved so that both the temperature and time of heating can be set differently in separate areas of your house; this will reduce the amount of energy used and lower fuel bills. For example, it is possible to have cooler temperatures in the bedrooms than in the living room provided internal doors are kept closed, and to have a longer heating period for the living room. A competent heating engineer should be asked to do this work.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>The warm air heating system would benefit from the addition of a programmer and room thermostat so that it switches off when no heat is required; this will reduce the amount of energy used and lower fuel bills. Insist that the thermostat switches off the warm air burner as well as the blower. A modern programmer can provide different time programmes for heating and hot water, allowing different time periods to be set for each; seven-day programmers also allow different heating patterns to be set for weekdays and weekends and holidays. A competent heating engineer should be asked to do this work.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>A condensing boiler is capable of much higher efficiencies than other types of boiler, meaning it will burn less fuel to heat this property. This improvement is most appropriate when the existing central heating boiler needs repair or replacement, but there may be exceptional circumstances making this impractical. Condensing boilers need a drain for the condensate which limits their location; remember this when considering remodelling the room containing the existing boiler even if the latter is to be retained for the time being (for example a kitchen makeover). Building Regulations apply to this work, so your local authority building control department should be informed, unless the installer is registered with a competent persons scheme¹, and can therefore self-certify the work for Building Regulation compliance.
